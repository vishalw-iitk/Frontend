#### This branch consists of my work with ReactJS

###### Here are the 2 projects which I have done using ReactJS
1. Currency converter
2. Flash Quiz

###
1. <b>Currenct converter</b>
  * This is my 1st webapp built using ReactJS. It aims to built a currency converter platform which would convert the amount from one currency into another.
  * Hooks used: useState and useEffect

2. <b>Flash quiz webapp</b>
  * This is again a ReactJS webapp which can generate a specific set of questions for a user and also let us know the answers as we click over those generated flashcards.
  * Hooks used : useState, useEffect and useRef
